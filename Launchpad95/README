Launchpad85 : Improved Novation Launchpad remote scripts with Step Sequencer and Device Controller

These scripts are modified version of Ableton Live 8.2.7 scripts for Novation Launchpad and provide the same functionality but add support for editing the midi clips using a step sequencer and Device Controller. It does not require any external tool like Max for Live (M4L) in order to work. This script is just a plain Live Control Surface Python Script.
